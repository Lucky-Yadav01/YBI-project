# Mileage Predictor 🚗🔍

A machine learning project that predicts the mileage (fuel efficiency) of bikes based on various input features like engine size, weight, and more. Developed as part of a data science internship at YBI Foundation.

## 📌 Description

This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset of bikes and predict mileage (kmpl - kilometers per liter). The aim is to assist users and manufacturers in estimating the fuel efficiency of bikes using accessible parameters.

## 🔧 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Multiple regression models tested and evaluated
- Final model trained using Linear Regression (with 85% accuracy)
- Model saved using `joblib` for deployment

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib

## 📁 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lucky-Yadav01/mileage-predictor.git
   cd mileage-predictor
